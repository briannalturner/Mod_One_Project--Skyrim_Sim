SKYRIM SIMULATOR

How to Use:

Go to Github repository, clone the repository and then open a terminal and type in 'ruby bin/run.rb'.


Object of the Game:

In this simulator you are dropped into the world of Skyrim. You start out in Riften with no friends and no money. Everything from here is up to you. You can complete quests for each city in order to gain money and reputation (and eventually to buy a home and become a thane) or you can kill everyone in sight. There are nine separate cities and your good deeds (or crimes) are tracked separately for each one. Once you become the thane of a city, however, you are immune to the law.

You can become a mass murderer, a champion, or a little of both. Have fun!
